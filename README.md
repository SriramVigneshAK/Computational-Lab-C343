# Computational-Lab-C343
This repo contains the solutions to C-343 Computational Lab course. \\
The NH3_eigenstate.jl uses direct operators in matrix forms(grid based) to solve the Schrodinger equation to get the eigenstate(s). \\
The numerov.py uses the numerov approximation to find the eigenstates of Ammonia inversioon double well potential.
